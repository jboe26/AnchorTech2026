      <p>
        At <strong>Anchor Tech Innovations</strong>, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our app or services.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Our app does not collect any personal data unless you explicitly provide it through interactions with Calendly or other integrated services. Data collected by third-party services (like Calendly) is managed under their respective privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        If any data is collected, it will solely be used to provide and improve our services, communicate with you, or comply with legal obligations. We do not sell, share, or distribute your personal information to third parties without your consent.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our app may integrate with third-party services such as Calendly. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them to understand how they handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use cookies or analytics tools in our app. Any data related to user activity is managed by third-party tools where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. We recommend that you take precautions to protect your data as well.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to access, update, or delete any personal information we hold about you. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:joshboepple@anchortech.org">joshboepple@anchortech.org</a> to make such requests. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: "#4A90E2" }}>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
      </p>
